# Meetup {bg=#eee}

* Found 400 members for MappingDC
* Handles event notifications
* Handles RSVPs
* Could handle dues

# Meetup Issue 1 {bg=#eee}

Hundreds of users may join your Meetup.

But only 2% show up for events.

Many don't return.

# Meetup Issue 2 {bg=#eee}

Meetup's cost of $200 / year is not sustainable.

# Meetup Issue 3 {bg=#eee}

It doesn't belong to OpenStreetMap.

What will WeWork do with Meetup?

Will it disappear like ~~GeoCities~~ Google Reader?


# Meetup Issue 4 {bg=#eee}

It's not OpenStreetMap specific.

It does not handle coverage, quality assurance, projects.

It does not discover the existing mappers.

The attention of users often diverted to other groups.

# Microcosm To Do {bg=#eee}

* Put group activity on the local map
* Show the changes that local mappers are making
* Add Notes that need to be resolved
* Discover mappers from scanning changesets
* Add a user's microcosm activity to their profile page
* Message blast
* Install on an OSM dev server

# Microcosm To Do {bg=#eee}

* Use Case: Help organize a mapathon
* Use Case: Hold pictures of Field Papers / notes for others to work on
* Write up remaining Cucumber scenarios
* Continue building this feature and create a PR
* Changeset review?

# Cucumber {bg=#eee}

```gherkin
Feature: Managimg a Microcosm
  In order to manage microcosms
  as an organizer
  I want to create and modify events
```

# Cucumber {bg=#eee}

```gherkin
  Background:
    Given there is a microcosm "MappingDC", "Washington, DC, USA", "38.9", "-77.03", "38.516 * 10**7", "39.472 * 10**7", "-77.671 * 10**7", "-76.349 * 10**7"
    And the microcosm has description "MappingDC strives to improve OSM in the DC area"
    And the microcosm has the "Facebook" page "https://facebook.com/groups/mappingdc"
    And the microcosm has the "Twitter" page "https://twitter.com/mappingdc"
    And the microcosm has the "Website" page "https://mappingdc.org"
    And I am on the microcosm "MappingDC" page
```

# Cucumber {bg=#eee}

```gherkin
  Scenario: Create an event
    Given there is a user "abe@example.com" with name "Abe"
    And this user is an organizer of this microcosm
    When user "abe@example.com" logs in
    And We are on the microcosm "MappingDC" page
    And We click "Upcoming Events"
    And We click "new event"
    And We set the event to "Update DC Bike Lanes", "DC Library", "We will update the dc bike lane data in OSM."
    And We submit the form
    And We are on the microcosm "MappingDC" page
    Then We should see "Update DC Bike Lanes"
```
